# Rafael Martínez Quiles  
### Data Analyst & AI Engineer • Computer Vision • Real-Time Data Systems • Business Analytics

Hi there 👋  
I’m Rafael, a Data & AI Engineer obsessed with building systems that *see*, *think*, and *decide* in real time.

My work sits at the intersection of **computer vision**, **ML engineering**, and **scalable data systems** — transforming raw images, video, and fragmented datasets into automated decision pipelines used by teams across product, engineering, and research.

I care deeply about clean data foundations, fast iteration loops, reliable deployment, and building AI that is both **practical** and **explainable**.

## 🚀 What I Do

### **Computer Vision & Real-Time AI**
- Real-time detection, tracking, and OCR (YOLOv8/YOLOv9, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Multimodal interpretability & XAI for object detection  
- Spatial analytics, Voronoi control maps, player tracking, radar tactical visualizations  
- Gesture recognition & touchless interfaces using MediaPipe + OpenCV  
- Multimodal knowledge graphs & RAG pipelines (text + image + audio + video)

### **Data Engineering & ML Systems**
- Automated ETL/ELT (Python • SQL • dbt • Airflow)
- Cloud: **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**
- Real-time decisioning systems for credit, underwriting & scoring
- Data modeling (star/snowflake), warehouse orchestration, quality (Great Expectations), CI/CD
- ML scorecards, feature engineering, classification/forecasting, SHAP explainability

### **Business & Analytics**
- Executive dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)
- Experimentation, forecasting, product analytics
- Bridging technical teams, business units, and research environments
