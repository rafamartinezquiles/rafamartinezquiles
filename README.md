# Rafael Martinez 
### Software Engineer & AI Engineer — Real-Time Computer Vision • ML Systems • Scalable Data Pipelines

I’m Rafael, a Software/AI Engineer building **real-time machine learning systems**, **high-performance computer vision pipelines**, and **production-ready data infrastructures** that power critical decision engines across organizations.

My work merges **deep learning**, **systems engineering**, and **cloud-native architecture**—designing solutions that are fast, reliable, and built for scale.

## ⚙️ Core Engineering Areas
- **Software Engineering:** Python, distributed systems, containerized microservices, low-latency inference, CICD.  
- **AI / ML Engineering:** model training + deployment (PyTorch/TensorFlow), scorecards, forecasting, SHAP, XAI pipelines.  
- **Computer Vision:** YOLO, OCR, tracking, geometric projections, multimodal understanding, event detection.  
- **Data Engineering:** dbt, Airflow, SQL, warehouse modeling, governed ETL/ELT at scale (AWS/GCP/Azure).  
- **Cloud Architecture:** S3/Lambda/Glue, Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift, Docker/Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Key Impact
- **90 days → <5 minutes**: built a real-time AI decisioning engine enabling 200× throughput & +50% approvals.  
- **95% latency reduction**: optimized CV pipelines (YOLO OCR) from 1,161s → 54s for 5G/6G multimedia services.  
- **98% manual work eliminated**: automated governed ETL/ELT with data contracts, lineage, SLAs/SLOs.  
- **+25% map accuracy**: geospatial systems with automated QC, workflows, and model-driven updates.
