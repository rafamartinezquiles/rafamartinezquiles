### Data Analyst & AI Engineer • Computer Vision • Real-Time Data Systems • Business Analytics

Hi there 👋  
I’m Rafael, a Data & AI Engineer obsessed with building systems that *see*, *think*, and *decide* in real time.

My work sits at the intersection of **computer vision**, **ML engineering**, and **scalable data systems**, transforming raw images, video, and fragmented datasets into automated decision pipelines used by teams across product, engineering, and research.

I care deeply about clean data foundations, fast iteration loops, reliable deployment, and building AI that is both **practical** and **explainable**.
