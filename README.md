# Rafael Martínez Quiles  
### AI Engineer & Data Systems Specialist — Computer Vision • Real-Time ML • Scalable Pipelines

I build **real-time computer vision systems** and **automated data pipelines** that convert raw video, imagery, and fragmented data into fast, reliable decision engines.

My work combines **deep learning**, **geospatial + temporal analysis**, and **production-grade data engineering** across AWS/GCP/Azure.

## 🧠 Core Focus Areas
- **Computer Vision:** real-time detection/tracking (YOLOv8/9), OCR, gesture recognition, spatial analytics, Voronoi control maps, radar-style projections.  
- **ML Engineering:** scorecards, forecasting, SHAP explainability, low-latency inference, cloud deployment.  
- **Data Engineering:** dbt, Airflow, Python/SQL, warehouse modeling, CI/CD, SLAs/SLOs, governed ETL/ELT.  
- **Real-Time Systems:** decision engines that reduce cycles from months → minutes.
